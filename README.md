# Word-Guess-Game
Homework 3 assignment

We were tasked with creating a hangman game and chose to do a retro style user interface.

My high level pseudocode started here:

1. Press any key to get started!!!
1. Display the word to be guessed by giving the correct amount of empty spaces
1. As the letters are guessed correctly replace the blank spaces with the guessed letters
1. When the user guesses the wrong letter the hangman starts to be drawn piece by piece
1. The wrong set of letters guessed by the user will be displayed while game is in place
1. Wins is the number of times the user guessed the word correctly losses 
1. Losses is when the hangman appears with both eyes crossed out
1. Whether the user loses or wins display the next word to be guessed to the user

I also took the liberty to leave the comments explaining what each line does inside the (./assets/javascript/game.js).
